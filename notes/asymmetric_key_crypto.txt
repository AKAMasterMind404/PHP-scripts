Asymmetric Key Cryptography:
Uses two different keys for encryption and decryption.

Public key: This key is used for encryption.
Private key: This key is used for decryption.


The public keys can be sent to both parties via
any medium without any security.

Working:

The public key is shared to both parties.
The sender uses the receivers public key to
encode the message. This gives us an encrypted
text. This text is sent to the receiver. The receiver
then uses his private key to decrypt the original
message.

Application:
Digital Signatures
Cryptography
encrypted browsing(SSL)

Eg: 
RSA encryption
Divide data into blocks. 
Blocks are encrypted individually and chained.
chained blocks are decrypted.
